# Bot That Will Complain For You

This bot will complain for you on twitter about your low internet speed!
1. Replace PROMISED_DOWN and PROMISED_UP with the speeds you are supposed to get.
2. Download the driver for a browser of your choice, I used edge and downloaded from this link : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
3. Create a .env file and put your Twitter info.

From there just run the bot and make your complaints known!
